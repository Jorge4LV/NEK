This is a simple API with endpoints for anime gifs. The API is hosted on Vercel and the gifs are stored on Cloudflare R2 Buckets.

## How to use

To use the API, you need to fetch the gifs from the following URL:

```
https://cdn-anime.lucia-dev.com/pats/
```

The URL above will return a random gif from the action `pats`. You can change the action to get gifs from different actions.

## Actions

| Function | Endpoint                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `pat`    | https://cdn-anime.lucia-dev.com/pats/ |
| `hug`    | https://cdn-anime.lucia-dev.com/hugs/ |

Thank you for using the API! If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
