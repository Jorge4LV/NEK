# Anime CDN

This is a simple project to create a CDN for anime gifs. The idea is to have a simple API to get gifs from a specific action.

## How to use

To use the API, you need to fetch the gifs from the following URL:

```http
https://cdn-anime.lucia-dev.com/pats/
```

The URL above will return a random gif from the action `pats`. You can change the action to get gifs from different actions.

## Actions

| Function | Endpoint                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `pat`    | https://cdn-anime.lucia-dev.com/pats/ |
| `hug`    | https://cdn-anime.lucia-dev.com/hugs/ |

Thank you for using the API! If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
